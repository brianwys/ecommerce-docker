      "Merge the Campaign and Performance departments, as their job responsibilities overlap, and both focus on campaign execution, optimization, and analysis.

Eliminating the Partnership department will distribute its responsibilities effectively among other departments, ensuring that partner relationships, collaborations, and satisfaction are well-managed.",

Activation can handle partner relationships, Brand can manage partner collaborations, and Campaign Performance can oversee partner satisfaction and reputation."
